A survey of unidentified 100 MeV gamma-ray sources is undertaken, with
the Whipple 10m telescope, with the objective of detecting very high
energy (>350 GeV) gamma-ray emission. The survey consists of nineteen
sets of observations of sources detected by the EGRET instrument on
the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory between 1991 and 1995. Results for
21 EGRET sources are reported; in some cases two EGRET sources are
close enough to be viewed in a single observation. For each EGRET
source, candidate associations are listed and the implications of each
candidate for VHE emission discussed. Finally, a study of the
performance of a next-generation ground based instrument, VERITAS,
using simulations is presented. The implications of the increased
sensitivity of such an instrument for suture gamma-ray surveys is
briefly discussed.
